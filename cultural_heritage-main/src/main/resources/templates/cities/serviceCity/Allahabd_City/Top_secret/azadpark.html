                            <p>A sprawling 133-acre green complex, Chandra Shekhar Azad Park was built in 1870. It is believed that the park was made to commemorate Prince Alfred's (Duke of Edinburgh) visit to Prayagraj. It is therefore also called Alfred Park. During the rule of the British, it was known as Company Bagh and was renamed as Chandra Shekhar Azad Park after the Indian freedom fighter, after he killed himself at the spot in 1831 while fighting against the officers of the Raj. In fact, the colt revolver, which the revolutionary used to shoot himself is exhibited in the Allahabad Museum that is housed inside the park's compound. An imposing statue of Azad is one of the highlights of this green area. The park is home to recreational areas for kids, a musical fountain, the Allahabad Public Library (also known as Thornhill Mayne Memorial), the Prayag Sangeet Samiti (an institution for music) and Madan Mohan Malaviya Stadium.</p>
