                            <p>At a distance of 6 km from Allahabad Railway Station, Alopi Devi Mandir is an ancient temple located in Alopi Bagh locality of Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. Situated near Triveni Sangam, it is one of the revered Shaktipeethas in India, and among the must-visit temples in Allahabad.</p>
                            <p>Dedicated Goddess Sati, Alopi Devi Mandir is a special temple where no idol of the mother or a mark of any organ has been kept instead a cradle is worshipped. According to legend, the paw of the right hand of Goddess Sati fell here and became invisible or missing, that is why this Siddhapeeth has been named Alop (disappeared) Shankari and a cradle has been placed here as a symbol. As per alternate legend, Alopi Mata is the newlywed bride who disappeared from the wooden carriage when the marriage procession was attacked by a group of robbers. The strange disappearance of the bride was deemed as a miracle and a temple was erected at the same site to worship the divine bride. There lies a wooden cot in the sanctum sanctorum, also known as the 'doli' of the new bride. </p>
                            <p>There is a platform in the middle of the temple courtyard where a pool is made. Above it is a special hammock or cradle, which is kept covered with red cloth. All devotees touch the cradle and feel blessed. It is believed that every wish of those who ask for protection by tying a thread on their feet or hands is fulfilled. The water of this pool is believed to have miraculous powers. One can also see the idols of Lord Hanuman and Nava Durga on temple premises.</p>
