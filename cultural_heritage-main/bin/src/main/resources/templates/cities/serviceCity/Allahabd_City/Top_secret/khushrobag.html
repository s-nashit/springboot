                            <p>Khusro Bagh in Prayagraj is an extensive green park housing the tomb of Prince Khusroo, the rebellious elder son of Emperor Jahangir and the grandson of Akbar. On Akbar's death, many wanted to crown him the emperor instead of Jahangir. He was imprisoned and then blinded. It is not certain how he died, but probably was killed with the connivance of Shah Jahan, his younger brother. Prayagraj, an ancient city and the holiest among the Hindu pilgrimages, is located on the confluence of three rivers – Ganga, Yamuna & Saraswati. It is called ‘triveni sangam’. In 16th century, Akbar rechristened it as Allahabad. Though the city primarily garners its fame for Triveni Sangam, Kumbh Mela & Magh Mela but several historical monuments turn out to be worth visiting tourist attractions in Allahabad. Hence, the city holds prominence on the map of Uttar Pradesh tourism for its cultural as well as historical heritage.</p>
                            <p>The influence of Mughal history can also be seen in Prayagraj. Mughals are famous for their architectures, wherever they have made buildings generally all the buildings are excellent in their own way. In the list of mausoleums, Khusro Bagh holds its own importance from both architectural and historical perspectives. Khusro Bagh in Prayagraj was built by Jahangir. The garden is spread over almost 40 acre, and the shape of garden is quadrangle. It is a large walled garden in which along with greenery there are three tombs. The three mausoleums are made mainly of red sandstone. The buildings mainly follow the tenets of Mughal architecture but some elements of Indian Rajputana style of architecture were also included. Carving on walls and ceiling enhances the beauty of mausoleums.</p>
                            <p>The greenery of garden is well maintained. Different kinds of flower plants like rose and marigold are maintained in the garden area. In addition to them, there are many trees of Guava in the garden. Mango, Banyan, Banana, and many other trees are also maintained there in rows. Prayagraj is also famous for its guavas; in Hindi, it is famous as “Allahabadi Amrood”.</p>
                            <p>Amidst a dense garden of trees is located tomb of Khusro. People confuse it with Amir Khusro but this tomb is not dedicated to him. It was built for the eldest son of Jahangir named Khusro. When Akbar died he was very dissatisfied with Jahangir. After the death of Akbar, Khusro had revolted against his father Jahangir, during 1606 AD. But Khusro was defeated and imprisoned at this place under the monitoring of Prince Khurram (later known as Shah Jahan). Before being imprisoned at Khusro Bagh, Khusro had to go through many punishments. He was compelled to watch people getting punished severely, who had supported him. Later on, he was partially blinded. Khusro was killed in 1615 AD while he was trying to escape from this place and, later after his demise, he was buried at this place itself. The construction of his tomb was completed in around 1622 AD.</p>
                            <p>The second tomb in the compound is of the first wife of Jahangir named Shah Begham. Shah Begham was a Rajput wife of Jahangir and also mother of Khusro. She was also known as Man Bai. Actually Shah Begham is a title which means the royal lady, and this title was given to her after the birth of his son Khusro.She was a brilliant lady and very loyal to Jahangir. After getting tired of the riots between Jahangir and Khusro, she tried to convince Khusro to be loyal to his father, but when she found her efforts of no avail, she had committed suicide by consuming opium. She died in 1604 AD and her tomb was constructed in 1606 AD. Her mausoleum is the earliest among the three tombs in this garden. It’s a three tiered building. This tomb was designed by the court artist of Jahangir named Aqa Reza. Other 8 children of Shah Begham were also buried here.</p>
                            <p>The third mausoleum was built for Jahangir’s daughter named Rajkumari Sultan Nithar Begham, but she was buried in Agra.It is considered to be built during 1624 and 1625.More interesting fact is that this mausoleum has been an important place during the First Freedom Struggle of India in 1857 AD. This place was used as headquarter of this movement in Allahabad by Liyaqat Ali. This tomb is in one corner of the garden.</p>
                            <p>The three mausoleums are in a straight line sequence. While entering the garden first mausoleum is of Shah Begham, second of Nithar Begham and the third one of Khusro.</p>
                            <p>Prayagraj (Allahabad) can be easily reached. It is well connected with flights, train and buses from all parts of India. On arrival at Prayagraj, auto-rickshaw, manually-pulled rickshaw or cabs can be hired easily. Khusro bagh is very near from Allahabad Railway Junction.</p>
