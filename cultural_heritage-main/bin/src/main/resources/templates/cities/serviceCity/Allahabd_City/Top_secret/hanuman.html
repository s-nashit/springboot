            <h2>Lete Hanuman ji</h2>
            <p>Located near Prayagraj Sangam, Bade Hanuman is seated in a lying posture. There is a huge crowd of devotees here every Tuesday and Saturday. Apart from this, after taking bath in Sangam in Prayagraj, devotees definitely take bath here. It was founded by a businessman from Kolkata.</p>
            <p>Popularly known as Lette Hanuman Mandir, Bade Hanuman Temple is dedicated to Hanuman, the monkey god. This temple is an underground pit that houses a huge lying idol of Hanumanji, which is six to seven feet below the ground. This is the only Lord Hanuman temple in the world where the idol is in a reclining position. As per the mythology, Hanuman rested here after burning Lanka. Another interesting thing to know about this temple is that one side of Lord Hanuman's statue is half immersed in the water of the River Ganges. In the monsoon season when the water level rises, it is believed that the water of the river rises to touch the feet of the deity. During this time, a lot of devotees come to visit this sacred sight.</p>
            <p>Inside the temple, there is a sanctum that houses the south-facing idol of Lord Hanuman in a reclining posture. With 20 feet long and 8 feet wide, the idol is said to be about 600-700 years old. Besides, there is a peepal tree and the 'Janaki Temple' in the vicinity of the temple. The temple is managed by the Baghambari Gaddi. The shrine is a popular pilgrim spot in the city and stays especially busy on Tuesdays and Saturdays.</p>
