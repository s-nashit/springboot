                            <p>At a distance of 7.5 km from Allahabad Railway Station, Shri Nagvasuki Temple is a sacred temple located in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. Situated in Daraganj, it is one of the renowned temples in Prayag and among the must-visit places during your Allahabad Trip.</p>
                            <p>The temple is dedicated to Lord Vasuki, the king of serpents, and is situated on the banks of the holy river Ganga. This ancient temple also finds mention in several religious scriptures including Matsya Purana. This temple is believed to be one of only two temples in India (the other being in Nasik) where one can be liberated from the bad effects of 'Kaal Sarpa Dosha'.</p>
                            <p>The temple traces its roots to the 10th century. The present structure of the temple is believed to have been constructed by Maratha king Shridhar Bhonsle during the 18th century and is a fine example of medieval architecture. Lord Vasuki resides in the sanctum sanctorum. There are also deities of Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh, Goddess Parvati, and a reclining statue of Bhishma Pitamaha in the premises of the temple. </p>
                        <p>On the occasion of the Naga Panchami, a fair is held near the temple every year. The temple attracts a huge number of devotees during this time.</p>
