                            <h2></h2>
                            <p>Located within the walls of Prayagraj Fort (earlier called Allahabad Fort) in Prayagraj , one of the holiest cities in Hinduism, the Ashoka Pillar (Ashok Stambha - अशोक स्तम्भ) stands as a testament to the region's ancient history, particularly during the Mauryan period. The fort is situated on the banks of the Yamuna River, near the confluence with the Ganga. This location is particularly important as it marks the site of the Triveni Sangam, the sacred meeting point of the two rivers (Ganga & Yamuna) and the invisible Saraswati River. The pillar, erected by Ashoka in 232 BC, is a single shaft of polished sandstone. It contains an Ashoka edict dating back to the Maurya dynasty's reign in the 3rd century BC. This pillar is significant not just for its Ashokan inscription but also for later engravings attributed to the Gupta emperor Samudragupta in the 4th century AD and the Mughal ruler Jahangir in the 17th century.</p>
                            <p>Architecture: The pillar is made of sandstone, a common material used in the construction of Ashoka's pillars across the Indian subcontinent. The stone was likely sourced from the region of Chunar, which is known for its high-quality sandstone. The pillar is characterized by its smooth, polished surface, which was a distinctive feature of Ashoka's pillars. It is 35 feet tall with a lower diameter of 35 inches and an upper diameter of 26 inches, reflecting the skill and engineering prowess of the craftsmen of the time. While the traditional lotus-shaped capital is missing, the pillar's base and decorative abacus featuring lotus and honeysuckle motifs remain. Archaeologist Alexander Cunningham speculated the original capital may have been a single lion, similar to the one found at Sankasya.</p>
                            <p>Location: Debate surrounds the pillar's original location. Some scholars believe it was relocated to Allahabad Fort by Akbar, though others dispute this claim, noting the lack of evidence supporting the pillar's relocation and the presence of earlier inscriptions suggesting it was already in its current location. The Indian Army now occupies the fort, and public access to the pillar requires special permission. The pillar has undergone several re-erections since the 13th century, including one during Jahangir's reign in 1605 AD. In the 18th century, the missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler recorded its appearance, and General Kyd later took it down in 1798 AD. By 1838 AD, Captain Edward Smith restored the pillar with a new lion capital, which Cunningham criticized for its size and appearance.</p>
                            <p>One theory suggests the pillar originated in Kaushambi, about 30 miles from its current location, based on the Ashokan inscriptions. It may have been moved to Prayagraj under Muslim rule. This theory is supported by the discovery of another broken pillar in Kaushambi, potentially part of a pair. However, Krishnaswamy and Ghosh proposed in 1935 AD that the pillar was never moved from its location at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, a significant pilgrimage site during Ashoka's time. They argue that the pillar was likely placed there by Ashoka himself due to the area's importance. These scholars dismiss the notion that the pillar was transported from Kaushambi due to its size and lack of historical records. John Irwin, in 1979 AD, also suggested the pillar had never been moved and had always stood at its current site. He further argued that the pillar's origin predates Ashoka and may be related to an ancient pillar cult. This pre-Buddhist history aligns with the presence of ancient settlements and a massive well in the area. Karel Werner supported Irwin's findings, noting the pillar's long history at Prayagraj as a center for ancient worship, rather than being moved from Kaushambi. This perspective challenges the traditional attribution of the pillar's origins solely to Ashoka.</p>
                            <p>Inscriptions: The Ashoka Pillar in Prayagraj contains inscriptions in the Brahmi script, which convey a series of edicts by Emperor Ashoka. The continuous lines of the inscription are etched around the column, featuring the same six edicts found on other pillars. The first and second edicts have survived in full. Only a couple of lines from the fifth edict remain, as the rest has been lost due to surface deterioration. The sixth edict is nearly intact, missing only about half a line. These edicts are similar to those found on other Ashokan pillars. Additionally, the Allahabad pillar features the Schism edict, the Queen's edict, and the Birbal Magha Mela inscription. The surviving Ashoka inscriptions exhibit uniformity in size, with precise and deep engraving. These edicts discuss moral and ethical issues, including the importance of non-violence, the welfare of the people, and the promotion of ‘Dharma’. They also detail Ashoka's support for religious tolerance and his desire to lead a just and fair government. In addition to Ashoka's inscriptions, the pillar also contains inscriptions from other historical figures, including Gupta emperor Samudragupta & Mughal ruler Jahangir. The iscription of Gupta-era was composed by Harisena, a well-known poet from the royal court. It lauds the noble works, valour and victories of Samudragupta. This additional layer of inscriptions provides insights into different periods of Indian history and the rulers who governed the region.</p>
                            <p>In nutshell, the Ashoka Pillar in Prayagraj is a significant historical monument that offers a glimpse into India's ancient past. Its inscriptions by Emperor Ashoka and subsequent rulers provide valuable insights into the region's history and the evolution of Indian culture and governance. As with many ancient monuments, the Ashoka Pillar in Prayagraj faces challenges related to preservation and maintenance, including environmental factors and human interference.</p>
