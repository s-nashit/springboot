                            <h2></h2>
                            <p>Eight km from the Railway Station, this fort founded by Akbar is situated on the bank of Yamuna overlooking the confluence. The fort consisted of 93 large apartments and hundreds of rooms and other edifices. The most capacious structure raised by Akbar is the Allahabad Fort . Its beauty, expanse and sturdiness is worth watching. It rivalled in design, elegance and craftsmanship even the Agra Fort in its heyday. Allahabad , originally known as Prayag since the time immemorial, is strategically situated on the confluence of rivers Ganga & Yamuna. This confluence is called Sangam. Lying on the confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna, the fort is wedge-shaped. In the olden days, Allahabad used to command a direct approach to Bengal, lying on the expanding eastern frontiers of the Mughal empire. Allahabad Fort, thus, was built with strategic purposes, military as well as commercial. With the passage of time, many original parts like roofs and interior have suffered severe loss and decay.
                                 The original roofed area has disappeared and the interior of the fort has been deprived of its former grace, glory and architectural grandeur. Another significant historical aspect of Allahabad Fort is that it houses one of the Ashokan Pillars. The Ashokan Pillar, with tributes to Samudra Gupta, carved on it, faces the main entrance of the fort. Even now-a-days, this fort is used as military base. Various regiments of Army are placed within it. When the fort came under British control they effected many changes in this edifice suiting to their requirements but unfortunately the changes proved detrimental to the original beauty of the fort. It is not open for general public but during Kumbh Mela in Allahabad (Prayag) and other auspicious Hindu festivals, a part of Allahabad Fort is opened for the faithful. Near the arsenal lies the Patalputi temple reminding the posterity about the relics of the ancient town of Prayag.</p>
