                            <p>At a distance of 6 km from Allahabad Railway Station, Mankameshwar Temple is a revered Hindu temple located on the banks of Yamuna River in the Cantonment area of Allahabad. Situated near the Saraswati Ghat, it is one of the most popular temples in Allahabad, and among the most visited places as part of Prayagraj Darshan.</p>
                            <p>Also known as Pishach Mochan Tirtha, Mankameshwar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is maintained by Sri Shankaracharya Trust. Mankameshwar means the God of the fulfillment of wishes and the temple derives its name from an interesting legend. Goddess Sita desired to pray to Lord Shiva following her ritual bathing at the Sangam. Since there was no Lord Shiva temple in the vicinity, Lord Rama built this temple to fulfill her wish. It is still believed that wishes made at this temple are fulfilled.</p>
                            <p>The temple houses a 3 and a half feet black stone Shivling and is said to have been installed by Lord Ram himself. One can also see the idols of Nandi and Lord Ganesh, Lord Hanuman, a Banyan and Peepal tree in the temple complex. There is also Rann Mukteshwar Shivling in the temple which literally means 'Great God, absolver of debts'. Devotees visit this temple and especially this particular Shivling to clear themselves debts and loans. Being located on the riverside, the temple also boasts some picturesque vistas of the surrounding that are hard to resist while visiting.</p>
                            <p>TThe temple attracts hundreds of pilgrims especially on Mondays and Shivratri, as these days are considered auspicious to pay homage to the deity of the temple. Navratri is also a wonderful time to visit the temple, but it can be massively crowded.</p>
