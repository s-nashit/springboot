                            <p>Allahabad Fort built by Akbar stands on the banks of the river Yamuna near the site of confluence (SANGAM) in italies with river Ganges. It is the location of the much revered Akshay Vat which means immortal tree. Legends say that if anyone jumped from this centuries old banyan tree he would attain immortality.The ancient Shankar Viman Mandapam temple is one of the most famous Shiva temples in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. Built in Nagara style of architecture, this intricately carved temple derives its name from Lord Shiva’s aircraft (viman) believed to have landed here. The main highlight is the swayambhu or self-manifested Shiva Lingam revered since the Puranic era. The mandapam has exquisitely carved pillars depicting Hindu gods, goddesses and mythical themes. Lord Shiva remains the primary deity while shrines of Parvati, Ganesha, Kartikeya and Durga are also present. Thousands of devotees visit during Shivratri and Shravan month to offer prayers. The temple carries great religious significance and is known for its architectural grandeur. The Shankar Viman Mandapam stands as a magnificent temple exemplifying ancient craftsmanship and the spirituality of Prayagraj. A visit here provides a peaceful experience as devotees connect with the aura of sanctity.</p>
                            <p>The history of the Shankar Viman Mandapam temple goes back centuries, though the exact date of construction is not known. As the name suggests, it derives its name from “Shankar” (another name for Lord Shiva), “Viman” (spacecraft or aircraft) and “Mandapam” (hall or temple).</p>
                            <p>According to Hindu legends, Lord Shiva arrived at this spot in Prayagraj in his celestial aircraft when he was in exile. When the aircraft was leaving, it stopped for some time at this place before proceeding further. A temple was later constructed to mark this holy spot where Lord Shiva had stepped off his viman. </p>
                            <p>The Shiva Lingam enshrined within the temple is swayambhu or self-manifested, believed to have existed since the Puranic times when Lord Shiva himself resided here. Devotees consider the Lingam extremely sacred and the temple finds mention in several Hindu scriptures.</p>
